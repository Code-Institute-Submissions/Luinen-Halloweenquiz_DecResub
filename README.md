## Features

I explain the website features below.

### **Existing features**
  

- **Main menu**
  - A solid page with Halloween style, there are three options. If you click on the start button, the game will start. 
  - If the users want to know more about the instructions, they can click on the rules button. 
  - And finally, the users can see the leaderboard if they click the high scores button.
  - The active button appears with black border and purple box shadow , which highlights it from the background.

- **Game Over page**
  - At the end of the quiz, the users can save their high score and enter their name, play again, or go back to the main menu. The form is easy to use and the placeholder helps the users.
